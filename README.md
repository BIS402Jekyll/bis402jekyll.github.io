# BIS 402 Jekyll Site

This is a Jekyll site for BIS 402. It is a simple site with a single page that was created in about 5 minutes.

First, go to Jekyll's Quickstart: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/> and follow the instructions.

Then, clone the repository:

```git
git clone https://github.com/BIS402Jekyll/bis402jekyll.github.io.git
```

When ready, build the site and make it available on a local server.

```ruby
cd bis402jekyll.github.io
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, go to the site and click the link to the page: `http://localhost:4000`

Note, if you are using Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher, step 5 may fail. You may fix it by adding webrick to your dependencies: `bundle add webrick`
